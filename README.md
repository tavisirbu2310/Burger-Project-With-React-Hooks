A page that simulates a real-life website for food ordering. Users can build their own burger and order it, not before logging in/signing up on the website. Firebase was used  for the authentication. Firebase was also used for storing other data from the users(like the built of the burger, name, address, zip code etc.). This project was created using React Hooks and Redux for managing the state.

The project is also live on the following address: https://my-burger-5df31.web.app/ 
The live project was built using React, without Hooks. The present project has been changed to have only functional components with the help of Hooks.

To run it:

1.Clone

2.Run npm install

3.Run npm start
